# Introduction to Machine Learning Midterm Project:
This is the project for my Machine Learning class at Queen Mary, University of London. 
For the project, I use Logistic Regression to predict the survivability of a passenger from the titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The method of opimisation is Gradient Descent. I build all of the alogrithm from scratch with Numpy as it is one of the requirement for the project.
